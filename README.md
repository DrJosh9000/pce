# PCE.js (DrJosh9000-flavoured)

You are looking at a fork of [James Friend](https://jamesfriend.com.au/)'s port of Hampa Hug's excellent [PCE](http://www.hampa.ch/pce/) emulator. 

This fork exists so I can tweak PCE and PCE.js for the purposes of improving [HyperCard Adventures](https://hypercardadventures.com), and contribute said tweaks back to the world.

Over time I expect this fork will diverge (I have no intention of supporting emulators other than Mac). Still, feel free to poke around.
